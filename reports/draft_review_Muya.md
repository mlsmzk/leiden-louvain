**Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?**
    My understanding of the experiment is that they are trying to replicate how algorithmic personalization affects models of opinion dynamics in social networks. The question it answers is how different types of personalization affect users' opinions in a social network. The team's explanation is clear since they describe the types of networks used, the personalization methods, and the overall goal of the study.

**Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?**

    I think the methodology is to simulate opinion dynamics emperically using various types of network models which makes sense given the question. The team have acknowledged all of their limitations.

**Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?**
    The results are very clearly presented for a first draft, and the visualization is very intuitive. Later on, I would suggest the team to add captions to their figures, and reformat the pictures so that the interpretation for each figure is under the figure. 

**Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?**
    The draft report interprets the results as an answer to the motivating questio. However, they also mentioned their concerns about the variance in the results and the issues with replicating some network types.

**Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?**
    The results are overall consistent with the original paper, but they still have challenges in replicating the same results from OLD personalization method, which is qunatitative. 

**Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?**
    The report did not point out explicity, but I believe their extension is to use the results of models to compare to a real world survey result, such as the National Longitudinal Surveys. This is an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer.

**Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?**
    The team seems to be on track, with a decently completed replication and a clearly defined extension. They are also very specific about the steos they will take to improve the replication accuracy and implementing the extension.

**Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guideLinks to an external site.?**
    The report is written in clear, concise, correct language, and is overall consistent given the amount work they have completed. It follows the guideline pretty well. 

**Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?**
    The report appears to be formatted professionally, and it has the right directory, a meaningful title, and the full names of the authors. The bibliography is located at the abstract, which I think should be acceptable(?).
